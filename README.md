# MR Headset

This is an open-source **Mixed Reality** headset that aims to augment the power of human imagination. It aims to do this by using high resolution displays and cameras, as well as a powerful ARM based CPU and GPU. 

The first revision of the board is currently being designed around the 6-core Rockchip [RK3399](http://rockchip.wikidot.com/rk3399) which has the Mali T860 MP4 ARM GPU. The camera uses the OV13850 4k sensor.
