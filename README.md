# MR Headset

This is an open-source **Mixed Reality** headset that aims to augment the power of human imagination. It aims to do this by using high resolution displays and cameras, as well as a powerful ARM based CPU and GPU. 

The current plan is to use a chip from the [i.MX8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.MX#i.MX_8) family of processors by NXP.
